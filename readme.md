# A React component to display components or execute functions using screen resolution conditions, on initial load of a web application


> When you use the IfScreen component, you don't have define "()" in functions only if the functions to execute are not a component JSX. Example: logic functions. Yet, if you want to define a JSX component, you have to write "()"


> You always must use the "scwidth" expression for define resolution, this is a reference from screen.width



> Once the website loads, depending on the width screen resolution, then a function or component will be activated


> This is not like a CSS "media query". In this case, any logical process of any nature can be executed according to specific resolutions at the time of loading
